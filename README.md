- Hi, Iâ€™m Prateek ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m a software engineer who is enthusiastic and curious about finding out how things work. This nature has driven me towards the field of computer science.
- The domains of my interest include Web-development (specially the middleware and the authentication setup of any web application), Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
- I am also highly interested in the areas of self-driving and object detection technologies and would like to work on either of these.
- I'm very passionate about motoring and sports journalism.
